## **Ex.1 | Javascript**

### Setup 

```javascript
let ready = (callback) => {
    if (document.readyState != "loading") callback();
    else document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", callback);
};

ready(() => {
    /* Do things after DOM has fully loaded */
});

```

#### **Challenges**

### Variables
- Variables are used to store values in memory
- Variables are declared with the `var` keyword
- Scoped Variables are declared with the `let` & `const` keyword
- Variables can be reassigned
- Variables can be declared with or without a value
- Variables can be declared with or without a type

>  **Create a variable called `studentArray` with no value assigned**

### Arrays
- An array can hold many values under a single name
- Arrays are declared with the `[]` symbol
- Arrays can hold any type of data
- Arrays can be declared with or without a typeÃ¥
- Arrays can access the values by referring to an index number

>  **Assign the `studentArray` variable to an array**

### Objects
- An object is a collection of key-value pairs
- Objects are declared with the `{}` symbol
- Objects can hold any type of data
- Objects can be declared with or without a type
- Objects can access the values by referring to a key

>  **Create an object with keys of name, location, email, githubUrl, linkedinUrl, resumeLink, type; then add your own values**

### Functions
- Functions are used to perform a specific task
- Functions are declared with the `function` keyword
- Functions can be declared with or without a type; 
- If no type is declared, the function will return `undefined`
- Functions can be called by using the `()` symbol
- Functions can be passed arguments
- Functions can be passed multiple arguments
- Functions can be passed a variable as an argument
- Functions can be passed an array as an argument

>  **Create a function named `loadCards` with a argunent of `studentArray`**

### Methods
- Methods are used to perform a specific task on a specific object
- Methods are declared with the `.` symbol
- Methods can be called by using the `()` symbol
- Methods can be passed arguments
- Methods can be passed multiple arguments

> **Use the `length` method on the `studentArray` variable to get the length of the array**

### Loops
- Loops are used to repeat a specific task
- Loops are declared with the `for` keyword
- Their are different types of loops, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do while` loops.
- All loops have a condition to check
- For loop conditions can be checked with the `if` keyword
- Loops have a different incrementer or decrementer

> **Create a for loop that iterates through the `studentArray` array and prints out the name of each student**

### Document Object Model
- The DOM is a representation of the HTML document
- The DOM is used to access and manipulate the HTML document
- You can use javascript to access and manipulate the DOM using the `document` object
- The `document` object is used to access the HTML document

> **Use the `document` object to access the `cards` element of the HTML document, store that data in a variable named `cardsDiv`**

#### **Final**

```javascript
let ready = (callback) => {
    if (document.readyState != "loading") callback();
    else document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", callback);
};

const studentArray = [
    {
        name: "Erik",
        location: "San Francisco",
        email: "3salaz.dev@gmail.com",
        locationImg: "https://levineleavitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OwenGildersleeve_SanFranciscoMag-Cover-1200x1440.jpg",
        githubUrl: "",
        linkedinUrl: "",
        resumeLink: "",
        type: "instructor",
    }
]

ready(() => {
    /* Do things after DOM has fully loaded */
    // Create An Array of Objects

    // Create An oject with key value pairs, have the keys be (name, age, location)
    function loadCards(studentArray) {
        let studentList = studentArray;
        const cardDiv = document.getElementById("cards");
        console.log(studentList.length);
        // for each currentStudent in array create a card and load it up with the currentStudent information.
        for (let i = 0; i < studentList.length; i++) {
            console.log(studentList[i]);
            let currentStudent = studentList[i];
            cardDiv.innerHTML += `
            <div class="card" id="card${i}">
                <h1 id="cardName">${currentStudent.name}</h1>
                <img src="${currentStudent.locationImg}">
                <h3 id="cardLocation">${currentStudent.location}</h3>
                <a id="cardEmail" class="link" href="mailito:${currentStudent.email}">ðŸ“§ Email</a>
                <section id="cardLinks">
                    <button id="cardGithubLink" class="btn1"><a class="link" href="${currentStudent.githubUrl}">Github</a></button>
                    <button id="cardResumeLink" class="btn1"><a class="link" href="${currentStudent.resumeLink}">Resume</a></button>
                </section>
                <button id="portfolio" class="btn2"><a href="">Portfolio</button>
            </div>
            `;
        }
    }

    loadCards(studentArray);
});
```

> [!Attention]
> **âœ… Final Objective:**
>For every object in the array, create a card with the data from the object.
## **Ex.2 | Node & NPM**

<!-- tabs:start -->


#### **Challenge**

### Node
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
- Node is used to create a server
- Node is used to create a command line interface
- Node is used to create a package manager
- Node is used to create a package

>  **Run node in the terminal**

### NPM
- Npm is a package manager for Node.js
- Npm is used to install packages
- NPM is initalized with the command `npm init`
- NPM stores packages in the `node_modules` folder
- NPM creates a package.json file
- NPM manages dependencies
>  **Install [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) with NPM**


1. Create a new js file and name it `index.js`
2. Initialize a node project with `npm -y`
3. Install the `express` & `nodemon` package using npm
4. Require the `express` package in your `index.js` file and save it to a variable called express.
5. Execute the `express` package and save it to a variable called `app`
6. Look at documentation in [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) to see how to use the `app` variable to set the static directory.
#### **Final**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.static('public'))

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`));


````
<!-- tabs:end -->

> [!Attention]
> **âœ… Final Objective:**
> Run your node server and have it display the contents of your pulic folder at the given URL you set at local host.


## **Lab ðŸ”¬**
 ### Full Stack Web Dev
> Objective: Create your first full stack web application. To be clear this is not going to be a full fledged web application. It is just a simple web application that will serve as a learning tool, and to get you started with the basics of javascript. You will be partnering with a peer to complete this lab.

> Prerequisites:
- JavaScript Basics
- Web Development Basics
- Git & Github Basics
- Terminal Basics
- Development Environment

Tasks:
- Create a new project and name it `lab-full-stack-web-dev`
- Partner up with someone and create a google chat between you guys so that you can discuss the lab.
- Decide who is going to create the repositoy and push the code to github.
- Create a firebase project @ https://firebase.google.com/
- Install the firebase cli @ https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli
- Use the firebase cdn to use firebase in your project files
- Initialize a firebase project
- Use the existing project you created
- Replace the public generated by firebase to your own public folder
- Use the firebase documentation to learn how to deploy your application with firebase.
- Send me the link to a live site.
