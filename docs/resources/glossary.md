### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.

It was designed for creating networked computer applications, but is used in many computing platforms, including client-side web browsers, servers, and embedded devices. JavaScript is designed to make it possible to make programs that can be run in a web browser, on a server, or in an embedded environment.
